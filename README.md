FeaturePerfDatasets
===================

Standard datasets used to evaluate visual features in computer vision.

They are simply taken from:
- "Affine Covariant Features" @ http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/
- "Kaze Features" @ http://www.robesafe.com/personal/pablo.alcantarilla/kaze.html, which uses the __Iguazu__ dataset
